# Reminiscence

## A Spatial Memory Application for iOS

Reminiscence is a sophisticated iOS application designed to associate memories with locations, creating a rich, location-aware personal journal. The app allows users to capture moments in their lives and tie them to specific places, enabling a unique way to reminisce and rediscover experiences through both time and space.

## Overview

Reminiscence transforms how we remember life's moments by adding a spatial dimension to our memories. Rather than organizing memories chronologically as traditional journaling apps do, Reminiscence creates a personal memory map, allowing users to:

- Record memories (text, photos, audio) at their current location
- Revisit places and explore memories tied to that location
- Discover patterns in their spatial memory through heatmaps and analytics
- Experience serendipitous memory triggers through location-based notifications

This spatial approach to memory storage mirrors how the human brain often associates memories with places, creating a more intuitive and emotionally resonant experience.

## Technical Architecture

Reminiscence is built using a modern SwiftUI-based architecture with key components that enable its rich functionality:

### Application Structure

- **SwiftUI-based UI Layer**: The entire user interface is built using SwiftUI, Apple's modern declarative UI framework
- **MVVM Architecture**: Follows Model-View-ViewModel pattern for clean separation of concerns
- **Core Data Persistence**: Leverages Core Data for efficient local storage of memories and associated metadata
- **MapKit Integration**: Utilizes Apple's MapKit for all mapping and location visualization features
- **CoreLocation Services**: Implements sophisticated location management for accurate positioning

### Component Overview

1. **ReminiscenceApp**: The main application entry point that configures global state and appearance
2. **AppDelegate**: Manages application lifecycle events and core system interactions
3. **AppLocationManager**: Centralizes location management to optimize battery usage and reliability
4. **MemoryViewModel**: Manages the business logic for memory operations
5. **UI Components**:
   - SplashScreenView: Initial loading screen with permission handling
   - MainTabView: Primary container for the app's main sections
   - MemoryMapView: Location-based visualization of memories
   - MemoryListView: List-based interface for memory browsing
   - StatsView: Analytics and metrics display
   - SettingsView: User configuration options

## Spatial Memory Concept

The core concept behind Reminiscence is "spatial memory," which acknowledges that human memories are often strongly tied to locations. The app implements this concept through:

### Geospatial Database
Memories are indexed not just by time but primarily by location coordinates, enabling:
- Proximity-based queries (e.g., "memories within 500m of current location")
- Spatial clustering for areas with many memories
- Memory density analysis through heatmaps

### Location Significance
The app treats locations with different levels of significance:
- Frequently visited locations are highlighted
- Places with multiple memories receive visual emphasis
- Notifications are prioritized for locations with emotional significance (based on memory content)

## Data Visualization

Reminiscence offers several powerful ways to visualize personal data:

### Memory Heatmap
- Visual representation of frequently visited or memory-rich locations
- Color gradient indicating memory density
- Configurable visualization parameters

### Memory Type Distribution
- Pie charts showing the distribution of memory types (text, photo, audio)
- Tag-based categorization analytics
- Time-based distribution patterns

### Location Analytics
- Most visited locations ranked by frequency
- Time spent analysis at different locations
- Correlation between location types and memory content

## Location Management

A sophisticated location management system powers Reminiscence's spatial capabilities:

### AppLocationManager
- Centralized location management to prevent battery drain
- Optimized location update frequencies based on user movement
- Geofencing capabilities for memory-associated locations
- Smart background location updates using significant location changes

### Permission Management
- Comprehensive permission request system
- Clear user communication about location usage
- Graceful degradation when permissions are limited
- Settings-based permission management

### Battery Optimization
- Configurable location accuracy settings
- Intelligent polling based on user movement
- Background location updates that minimize power consumption
- Settings to fine-tune the balance between functionality and battery life

## Privacy and Permissions

Reminiscence is designed with privacy as a core principle:

### Location Permissions
- **When In Use**: Basic functionality with location tracking only while app is active
- **Always Allow**: Enhanced features including background notifications
- **Clear Explanations**: Detailed permission dialogs explaining the benefits of each level
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: App remains functional even with limited permissions

### Data Storage
- All data stored locally on device by default
- No server-side processing of sensitive location information
- Optional cloud backup with encryption
- User controls for data management and deletion

## Core Technologies

Reminiscence leverages several core iOS technologies:

### SwiftUI
- Modern declarative UI framework
- Composable view architecture
- Reactive updates with @State and @EnvironmentObject
- Animation and transition systems

### Core Location
- Location services management
- Authorization handling
- Geofencing capabilities
- Background location updates

### MapKit
- Map rendering and interaction
- Custom annotation support
- Overlay rendering for heatmaps
- User location tracking

### Core Data
- Persistent storage of memory data
- Efficient querying and filtering
- Data relationship management
- Background saving and loading

### Combine
- Reactive programming approach
- Event handling and processing
- State management
- Asynchronous operations

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- iOS 14.0 or later
- iPhone or iPad device
- Location Services enabled
- Camera and Microphone access for full functionality

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `Reminiscence.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Select your development team in project settings
4. Build and run on your device or simulator

### Initial Setup
When first launching Reminiscence:
1. Allow location permissions when prompted for best experience
2. Grant notification permissions if desired
3. Complete the optional onboarding tutorial
4. Create your first memory at your current location

## Troubleshooting

### Location Services
- Ensure Location Services are enabled in Settings > Privacy > Location Services
- For background notifications, grant "Always" permission
- If location indicators don't appear, restart the app

### Memory Creation
- Ensure sufficient device storage for photo and audio memories
- Grant camera and microphone permissions when requested
- If media capture fails, check app permissions in Settings

### Map Issues
- If map doesn't load, check internet connectivity
- For location accuracy issues, try toggling Location Services
- Map performance may vary based on device capabilities
