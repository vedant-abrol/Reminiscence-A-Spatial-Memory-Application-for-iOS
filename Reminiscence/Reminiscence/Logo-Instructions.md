   - Subtle memory/location theme elements (like a map pin or brain neuron pattern)
   - Gradient colors that evoke memory and nostalgia (blue to purple gradient)
   - Clean, modern aesthetic with rounded corners

2. **Color Palette:**
   - Primary: Gradient from #4A6FFF (blue) to #9C4AFF (purple)
   - Background: Either white (#FFFFFF) for light mode or dark blue (#1A1A2E) for dark mode
   - Optional accent: Light teal (#4AFFEA) for highlights

3. **Dimensions:**
   - Create a 1024x1024 pixel master image (App Store requirement)
   - Ensure the design works well when scaled down to smaller sizes
